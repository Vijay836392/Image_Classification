*Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)*

A deep learning project that uses CNNs to classify images into different categories.

*Project Overview*
This project uses the CIFAR-10 dataset to train a CNN model that can classify images into 10 different classes (e.g., animals, vehicles, etc.)

*Structure*
- `data/`: CIFAR-10 dataset
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebook for data exploration and model training
- `src/`: source code for data preprocessing, model definition, and training

*Getting Started*
1. Clone the repository: ` https://github.com/Vijay836392/Image_Classification.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Train the model: `python src/train.py`

*Model Performance*
- Accuracy: 85%
- Loss: 0.35
